# Firebase Security Rule Timing Issue

This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in Firebase involving security rules and asynchronous operations.  Even with seemingly correct security rules, client-side write operations may fail due to timing issues or mismatches between the client's authentication state and the rules' expectations.

## Problem

The `firebaseBug.js` file contains client-side code attempting to write user data to the Firebase Realtime Database.  The corresponding security rules (`firebase.rules`) appear to be properly configured to allow only authenticated users to write their own data.

Despite this, writes often fail with errors indicating insufficient permissions. This happens because the authentication status might not be fully synchronized when the write operation is initiated.

## Solution

The `firebaseBugSolution.js` file shows a more robust approach that handles potential authentication delays using promises or async/await.

## Steps to reproduce

1. Set up a Firebase project.
2. Configure your Firebase security rules as shown in `firebase.rules`.
3. Run `firebaseBug.js` to see the error.
4. Run `firebaseBugSolution.js` to see the corrected behavior.
